See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"divine domain":{"description":"Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains.

Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"life domain":{"description":"The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life.

Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\n\n***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\n\n***Cantrip.*** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.

When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\n\n***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n\n***The Book's Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n```","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"danger sense":{"description":"At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\n\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\n\nThe college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.\n\n### Bonus Proficiencies\n\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\n\n### Cutting Words\n\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.

Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.\n\nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.\n\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"blessed healer":{"description":"Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.\n\n##### Beast Shapes\n\n|Level|Max. CR|Limitations|Example|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2nd|1/4|No flying or swimming speed|Wolf|\n|4th|1/2|No flying speed|Crocodile|\n|8th|1|—|Giant eagle|\n\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"druid circle":{"description":"At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles.

You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"circle of the land":{"description":"The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.\n\n### Bonus Cantrip\n\nYou learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.\n\n### Natural Recovery\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest\n\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\n\n### Circle Spells\n\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.\n\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\n\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself.

If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.

you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"divine health":{"description":"By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"sacred oath":{"description":"When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever.

Now you choose from the list of available oaths.\n\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\n\n#### Oath Spells\n\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\n\n#### Channel Divinity\n\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n```\n##### Breaking Your Oath\n\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\n\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.\n\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide.\n```","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"aura of protection":{"description":"Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

Rough living grates on me. |\n| 8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |\n\n| [d6](roll \"1d6\") | Ideal |\n|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Tradition.

(Any) |\n\n| [d6](roll \"1d6\") | Bond |\n|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago. |\n| 2 | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic. |\n| 3 | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died. |\n| 4 | Everything I do is for the common people. |\n| 5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served. |\n| 6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy. |\n\n| [d6](roll \"1d6\") | Flaw |\n|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. |\n| 2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy. |\n| 3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. |\n| 4 | I am inflexible in my thinking. |\n| 5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. |\n| 6 | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"infuse item":{"description":"At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue\nmundane items with certain magical infusions.\nThe magic items you create with this feature are\neffectively prototypes of permanent items.\n\n#### Infusions Known\n\nWhen you gain this feature, pick three artificer\ninfusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer\nInfusions” section at the end of the class’s\ndescription.

You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [2d8](roll \"2d8\") bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes [2d8](roll \"2d8\") bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"blight":{"description":"*4th-level necromancy*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nNecromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it.

You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.

Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.\n\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\n\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\n\nA magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\n\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"antipathy/sympathy":{"description":"*8th-level enchantment*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 hour  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)  \n**Duration:** 10 days  \n\n---\n\nThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.

When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\n\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.\n\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\n\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\n\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"arcane eye":{"description":"*4th-level divination*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\n\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.\n\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction.

If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\n\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to [2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \"2d6+spell\").\n\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by [2d8](roll \"4d8+2d8*slot5\") and the damage from the grasping hand increases by [2d6](roll \"2d6+2d6*slot5\") for each slot level above 5th.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"arcane lock":{"description":"*2nd-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Until dispelled  \n\n---\n\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration.

You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\n\nMask.

This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\n\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation.

Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\n\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [5d8](roll \"5d8\") acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by [1d8](roll \"5d8+1d8*slot3\") for each slot level above 3rd.

The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.\n\nThe information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: \"Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of the Round, lover and beloved of Arthur, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Avalon on the lips.\n\n\"","sources":["SRD"]},"lesser restoration":{"description":"*2nd-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it.

If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.  \n- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.  \n- Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"magic jar":{"description":"*6th-level necromancy*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)  \n**Duration:** Until dispelled  \n\n---\n\nYour body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.\n\nYou can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.\n\nOnce you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.\n\nMeanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all.\n\nWhile possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.\n\nIf the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet.

Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\n\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\n\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"magic weapon":{"description":"*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Paladin, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon.

You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.\n\nBeyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\n\nYou can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).\n\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"mass cure wounds":{"description":"*5th-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.\n\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\n\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.\n\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days.

The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.\n\nThe target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check.

The terrain's general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.\n\nSimilarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.\n\nThe illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.\n\nCreatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"mislead":{"description":"*5th-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing.

One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.\n\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.\n\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.\n\nA modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.\n\nA remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"moonbeam":{"description":"*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.

You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension.

Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\n\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"planar binding":{"description":"*5th-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 hour  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours  \n\n---\n\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell.

At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.\n\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"plane shift":{"description":"*7th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence.

If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\n\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw.

The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\n\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.\n\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\n\nThe target's gear melds into the new form.

If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\n\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\n\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\n\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\n\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.\n\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\n\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\n\nDuring this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"shatter":{"description":"*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range.

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\n\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.\n\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"speak with plants":{"description":"*3rd-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\n\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\n\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM's discretion.

The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.\n\n|Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |\n|------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|\n| Permanent circle | — | — | — | 01-100 |\n| Associated object | — | — | — | 01-100 |\n| Very familiar | 01-05 | 06-13 | 14-24 | 25-100 |\n| Seen casually | 01-33 | 34-43 | 44-53 | 54-100 |\n| Viewed once | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-100 |\n| Description | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-100 |\n| False destination | 01-50 | 51-100 | — | — |\n\nFamiliarity. \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.\n\n\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\n\n\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is [1d10](roll \"1d10\") × [1d10](roll \"1d10\") percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes [3d10](roll \"3d10\") force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n\n","sources":["SRD"]},"teleportation circle":{"description":"*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n\n---\n\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\n\nMany major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.\n\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\n\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.\n\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\n\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.\n\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\n\nThe target's gear melds into the new form.

You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\n\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:  \n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.  \n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.  \n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.  \n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.  \n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take [1d10](roll \"1d10\") necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for [2d4](roll \"2d4\") days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. \n\n ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* [+6 to hit](to hit \"6\"), reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* [7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage](roll \"1d8+3\"). \n\n ***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears. \n\n"},"sources":[],"asset":"asset://16253a6211ebe9a9a09a60ebe208b311"},"cloud giant":{"name":"Cloud Giant","settings":"size%3DHuge+%26semi%3B+variant%3D0","type":"giant","alignment":"neutral","ac":"14 (natural armor)","hp":"200 (16d12 + 96)","speed":"40 ft.","str":27,"dex":10,"con":22,"int":12,"wis":16,"cha":16,"save":"Con +10, Wis +7, Cha +7","skill":"Insight +7, Perception +7","senses":"passive Perception 17","languages":"Common, Giant","challenge":"9 (5,000 XP)","feats":{"Features":"***Keen Smell.*** The giant has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. \n\n ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The giant's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\n\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\n***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [dancing lights](spell \"Dancing Lights\"), [minor illusion](spell \"Minor Illusion\"), [vicious mockery](spell \"Vicious Mockery\")\n\n***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes [3d10](roll \"3d10\") psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\n\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n1st level (4 slots): [identify](spell \"Identify\"), [ray of sickness](spell \"Ray of Sickness\")\n\n2nd level (3 slots): [hold person](spell \"Hold Person\"), [locate object](spell \"Locate Object\")\n\n3rd level (3 slots): [bestow curse](spell \"Bestow Curse\"), [counterspell](spell \"Counterspell\"), [lightning bolt](spell \"Lightning Bolt\")\n\n4th level (3 slots): [phantasmal killer](spell \"Phantasmal Killer\"), [polymorph](spell \"Polymorph\")\n\n5th level (2 slots): [contact other plane](spell \"Contact Other Plane\"), [scrying](spell \"Scrying\")\n\n6th level (1 slot): [eyebite](spell \"Eyebite\")\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability.

For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
