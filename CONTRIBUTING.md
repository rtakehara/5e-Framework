# How to Contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

### Reporting Bugs

Before oppening a bug report:

- **Make sure the bug is not already reported** searching on GitHub under Issues.
- **Check the FAQs on the Wiki** for a list of common questions and problems.
- **Do not open a bug report to ask questions**. Ask them on [RP Tools forum](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=28435) or MapTool's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hbn2bfn)

If you didn't find an existing issue for the problem, open a new one using the Bug report template and add a **clear title and decription**, including steps on how to reproduce the problem and MapTool and Framework versions.

### Suggesting Features

Before oppening a feature request: 

- Check the **Wiki**, maybe the feature is already available.
- Check if the feature you want is not already requested searching on GitHub under Issues.

If the feature or request doesn't exist, open a new one using the Feature request template and add a **clear title and decription**, include why you think the feature is important and feel free to suggest how to implement it.

### Writing articles on the Wiki

You can help a lot by writing articles and guides on the wiki pages, if you don't know where to start, open the Wiki and search for a topic that you understand, if it's incomplete, feel free to improve, if it doesn't exist, feel free to create a new page.

Before creating a new page:

- Be sure the subject isn't alredy adressed under another title.
- If you want to write about a workaround for a bug, or missing feature, open a bug repport or feature request instead.

You can also change the wikis to fix grammar and spelling, include clearer language or detail features.
